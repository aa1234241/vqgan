Bug fixed version of [Dominic Rampas](https://github.com/dome272/VQGAN-pytorch)'s VQGAN implementation. Many thanks to the original repo.

## Update
The original implementation has some bugs.
- Visualization error, as shown in the example above. I have corrected it.
- Perceptual loss error. The NetLinLayer do not have right name, so the pretrained model failed to load weights on them.
have fixed this issue by replace it with official VQGAN code.
- Also the decorder part in VQGAN model seems not coorect, I replace the encoder and decoder
using the official VQGAN code.
- For the gan loss. The disc-start should not too early, previous give value is 10000, repalce it with 100000.
- Also, the disc-factor is too large, pervious is 1, change it to 0.2
- I also find the gan loss is become smaller as the training progressed. The lbd value converge to a very small value liek 0.02 after 200 epochs.
- The original code the codebook do not have a normalization operation. This cause many entry of the codebook not used during training.
Add the embedding normalization made the codebook usage rage grow significantly.

# VQGAN
Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Networks (VQGAN) is a generative model for image modeling. It was introduced in [Taming Transformers for High-Resolution Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09841). The concept is build upon two stages. The first stage learns in an autoencoder-like fashion by encoding images into a low-dimensional latent space, then applying vector quantization by making use of a codebook. Afterwards, the quantized latent vectors are projected back to the original image space by using a decoder. Encoder and Decoder are fully convolutional. The second stage is learning a transformer for the latent space. Over the course of training it learns which codebook vectors go along together and which not. This can then be used in an autoregressive fashion to generate before unseen images from the data distribution.

Note: Let the model train for even longer to get better results.
